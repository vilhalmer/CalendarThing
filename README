----------------------
Basic Functionality
----------------------

Upon execution this program will output a simple visual calendar
showing the days in the current month. Below this a list of the 
events for the current day and the day after that will also be 
shown.

----------------------
Command Line Arguments
----------------------

Options:
        view     View accepts either two date arguments of the
                 form YYYY-MM-DD or prompts the user for them.
                 This is used as a range for events to be
                 displayed, along with a listing of days in the
                 first month of the range.
					 
                 Example: java CalendarThing view 2014-2-1 2014-2-2
				 
        add      Add a new event to the calendar's data file.
                 Arguments can be passed in at runtime and the
                 program will prompt the user for the rest.
                 Accepted arguments at runtime ate date in
                 YYYY-MM-DD and Time in HH:MM
				 
                 Example: java CalendarThing add 2014-2-1
                       or java CalendarThing add 2014-2-1 11:30
					   
        remove   Remove an event from the calendar's data file.
                 An initial date argument in the form of 
                 YYYY-MM-DD must be past in to run. Afterwords a 
                 numbered listing of events for the day will be 
                 given, followed by a prompt to select an event
                 from its number.

                 Example: java CalendarThing remove 2014-2-1
		         
        edit     Edit an event in the calendar's data file. An 
                 initial date argument in the form of YYYY-MM-DD
                 must be past in to run. Afterwords a numbered 
                 listing of events for the day will be given, 
                 followed by a prompt to select an event from its
                 number.

                 Example: java CalendarThing edit 2014-2-1
